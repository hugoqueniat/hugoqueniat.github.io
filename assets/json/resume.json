    "summary": "I am a first-year PhD student in the Statistics CDT at the University of Warwick working under the joint supervision of Prof. Gareth Roberts and Dr Nick Tawn. My research interests lie in the area of Monte Carlo methods and probabilistic machine learning. Currently, I am working on tempering techniques to sample from multimodal target distributions. My work is part of the OCEAN research grant. Prior to joining the University of Warwick, I completed the MSc Mathematics Vision Learning organized by ENS Paris-Saclay and awarded by Institut Polytechnique de Paris. My Master's thesis, titled \"On the Limits and Extensions of the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler\", was completed here in Warwick and supervised by Prof. Gareth Roberts. It focused on the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler, studying its applicability to the sampling from distributions exhibiting non smooth and/or non regular modes. At the same time, I completed the MSc in Engineering from Télécom Paris.",
