<p>Hi there! I am a second-year PhD student in the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/">Statistics CDT</a> at the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/">University of Warwick</a>, working under the joint supervision of <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts">Prof. Gareth Roberts</a> and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/tawn/">Dr. Nick Tawn</a>.
<p>Prior to this, I graduated with an MRes. in Mathematics, Vision and Learning ("<a href="https://www.master-mva.com">MVA</a>") at <a href="https://www.ens-paris-saclay.fr">École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay</a> and an MSc. in Engineering from <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/engineering">Télécom Paris</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Research interests:</strong> I am broadly interested in the study of problems at the interface of learning and sampling. Currently, I am working on tempering techniques to sample from multimodal target distributions. My work is supported by the <a href="https://oceanerc.com/">OCEAN</a> ERC Synergy grant.</p>
