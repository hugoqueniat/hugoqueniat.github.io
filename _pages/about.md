 <p>I am a second-year PhD student in the Statistics CDT at the University of Warwick working under the joint supervision of <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/roberts">Prof. Gareth Roberts</a> and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/tawn/">Dr Nick Tawn</a>. My research interest lie at the interface of learning and sampling. Currently, I am working on tempering techniques to sample from multimodal target distributions. My work is part of the <a href="https://oceanerc.com/">OCEAN</a> research grant.</p>

    <p>Prior to joining the University of Warwick, I completed the MRes. <a href="https://www.master-mva.com">Mathematics Vision Learning</a> organized by ENS Paris-Saclay. My Master's thesis, titled "On the Limits and Extensions of the Annealed Leap-Point Sampler", was completed here in Warwick and supervised by Prof. Gareth Roberts. It focused on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12908"> Annealed Leap-Point Sampler</a>, studying its applicability to the sampling from distributions exhibiting non smooth and/or non regular modes. At the same time, I completed the MSc in Engineering from <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/engineering">T&eacute;l&eacute;com Paris.</a></p>
