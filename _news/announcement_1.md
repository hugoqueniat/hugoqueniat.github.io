After a successful research retreat in Paris in late July, I will be co-organizing with Gareth Roberts and Filippo Pagani the Acceleration Week in Warwick in September for the OCEAN ERC project. This event will bring together researchers from various institutions to discuss advancements in sampling methods and their applications. Looking forward to an exciting week of collaboration and learning!
